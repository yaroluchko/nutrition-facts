Nutrition Facts Component
Allows you to quickly write the main nutrition facts for a product.
Calories are manually computed from the macronutrients, so there is no need for that html property.The html properties of this component are:
serving size,
carbohydrates,
fat,
protein,
vit-a-perc (vitamin a percentage),
vit-c-perc (vitamin c percentage),
calcium-perc (calcium percentage),
iron-perc (iron percentage)

The customizable css components of this component are:
Text color (color css property),
Background color (background-color css property).

These are changed within the tag for the attributes, and the color and bg-color can be changed by setting the proper variables in the style attribute of the component.
