serving
carbohydrates
fat
protein
vit-a-perc (vitamin a percentage)
vit-c-perc (vitamin c percentage)
calcium-perc (calcium percentage)
iron-perc (iron percentage)

The customizable css components of this component are:

Background color (background-color css property)

These are changed within the tag for the attributes, and the color and bg-color can be changed by setting the proper variables in the style attribute of the component.
